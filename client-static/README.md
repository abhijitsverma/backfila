# client-static

Backfila client backend implementation to backfill a statically defined datastore. This allows you to
backfill special values that are checked into the code.

Note: `static` is a reserved word even for package names in java but not in kotlin. So I use `stat` 
in the package name instead.

The code is the source of truth for this client. Keep that in mind. Always refer to the code for implementation details.
